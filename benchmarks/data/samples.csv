politics,Lord Scarman  93  dies peacefully, Distinguished lawyer Lord Scarman  who conducted the inquiry into the 1981 Brixton riots  has died aged 93.  The peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career  serving as Law Commission chairman in its first seven years. He also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in Northern Ireland. Paying tribute  the Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said Lord Scarman was one of the     great advocates of our generation    .      His legacy from his decisions in the Lords and the Court of Appeal is substantial.     His work in the wake of the Brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none.      A great judge  a great lawyer and a great man.     Lord Scarman's nephew George Ritchie said the peer  who passed away peacefully on Wednesday  would be     sadly missed    .  The Lord Chief Justice  Lord Woolf  who is the most senior judge in England and Wales  said it was Lord Scarman's     pioneering work     which paved the way for the Human Rights Act 1998.     He was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature  and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society      he said.     He was  personally  totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him.      Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss  the president of the Family Justice Division  said Lord Scarman was a     good and humane judge     and one of the greatest figures of the late 20th century. Lord Scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in Brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery. During the following three days of disturbances that spread to the Midlands  Merseyside  Bristol and Leeds  nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight.  The inquiry famously settled on the so-called     rotten apples     theory  which argued that only a few police officers were racist  saying most were not. It spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the Police Complaints Authority. Trevor Phillips  chair of the Commission for Racial Equality  praised Lord Scarman's     ability to listen    . He said:     When Lord Scarman toured the streets of Brixton his presence was electrifying.     A community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the English establishment.     His great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds  many of whose language he could barely understand  genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings.     He never lost the special combination of wisdom  humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the Brixton riots.
entertainment,Casino Royale is next Bond movie, Casino Royale  author Ian Fleming's first James Bond book  is to be the next Bond film  with Goldeneye director Martin Campbell behind the camera.  It will be the 21st James Bond film to hit the big screen  and speculation has been rife over who will play the lead. Casino Royale was turned into a spoof spy movie by John Huston in 1967  with David Niven in the lead role. Pierce Brosnan led the past four Bond films but said producers axed him after offering him the chance to return. Among the favourites to take over the coveted role are Scottish actor Dougray Scott  Oscar nominee Clive Owen and Australian star Hugh Jackman. Producers say no decision has yet been made on who will become the seventh actor  including Niven  to play Bond on film. Kill Bill director Quentin Tarantino had talked of wanting to take on the Casino Royale project  and said he had spoken to Brosnan about it.  Shooting on Casino Royale is expected to begin once Campbell has finished work on The Legend of Zorro  a sequel to The Mask of Zorro  starring Catherine Zeta Jones and Antonio Banderas. Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson expect the film to be released in 2006.  The script will once again be developed by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who have both worked on two previous Bond movies. Fleming's book saw the introduction of Bond pitted against a Russian spy in a game of baccarat. Simultaneously  a woman arrives on the scene to take his eye off the game. The novel is one of Fleming's most violent and sadistic stories  with 007 suffering a savage beating from his nemesis Le Chiffre. In addition to the 1967 film  it was also adapted for television in 1954 with actor Barry Nelson as an Americanised     Jimmy     Bond. MGM Vice Chairman Chris McGurk said:     Martin (Campbell) is an incredibly exciting film-maker. Goldeneye was a wonderful movie and helped reinvigorate the Bond franchise. We're thrilled to have him back to direct the newest Bond.     New Zealand-born Campbell moved to the UK in 1966 and directed TV series such as The Professionals  Minder and Bergerac. His film credits include Edge of Darkness  Vertical Limit and Beyond Borders  which starred Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen. 
sport,Bortolami predicts dour contest, Italy skipper Marco Bortolami believes Saturday's Six Nations contest against Scotland will be a scrappy encounter.  With both sides looking for their first win of the championship  the third-round game at Murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider. And Bortolami feels the Edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs.     It will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win      said the lock forward. Italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the Six Nations in 2000  but two of those have come against Scotland. This year  Italy opened up with a stubborn display against Ireland but ended up losing 28-17.  However  they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive Welsh side in Rome last time out. Now the Italians travel to Edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the Six Nations.     Scotland played extremely well against France in Paris but not so well when Ireland came to Edinburgh      said Bortolami.     We are still very disappointed with our last game against Wales in Rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs.     As a nation  our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games.  
tech,ITunes user sues Apple over iPod, A user of Apple's iTunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an iPod to play songs.  He says Apple is breaking anti-competition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site. Apple  which opened its online store in 2003 after launching the iPod in 2001  uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the iPod. Californian Thomas Slattery filed the suit in the US District Court in San Jose and is seeking damages.      Apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice      the lawsuit states. The key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like iTunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market  according to Ernest Gellhorn  an anti-trust law professor at George Mason University.     As a practical matter  the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims      Prof Gellhorn said. Apple has sold more than six million iPods since the gadget was launched and has an 87% share of the market for portable digital music players  market research firm NPD Group has reported.  More than 200 million songs have been sold by the iTunes music store since it was launched.     Apple has unlawfully bundled  tied  and/or leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players  and vice-versa      the lawsuit said. Mr Slattery called himself an iTunes customer who     was also forced to purchase an Apple iPod     if he wanted to take his music with him to listen to. A spokesman for Apple declined to comment. Apple's online music store uses a different format for songs than Napster  Musicmatch  RealPlayer and others. The rivals use the MP3 format or Microsoft's WMA format while Apple uses AAC  which it says helps thwart piracy. The WMA format also includes so-called Digital Rights Management which is used to block piracy.  
tech,Broadband in the UK growing fast, High-speed net connections in the UK are proving more popular than ever.  BT reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. The 600 000 connections take the total number of people in the UK signing up for broadband from BT to almost 3.3 million. Nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. Britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of Europe.  According to figures gathered by industry watchdog  Ofcom  the growth means that the UK has now surpassed Germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. The UK total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people  compared to 6.7 in Germany and 15.8 in the Netherlands. The numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name. Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.  Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. The standard speed is 512kbps  though faster connections are available.     This breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas      said Paul Reynolds  chief executive of BT Wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. BT Retail  which sells net services under its own name  also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. This was a slight increase on the previous three months. Despite the good news about growth in broadband  figures from telecommunications regulator Ofcom show that BT faces increasing competition  and dwindling influence  in other sectors. Local Loop Unbundling  (LLU)  in which BT rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer's home or office  is growing steadily. Cable & Wireless and NTL have announced that they are investing millions to start offering LLU services. By the end of September more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called Carrier Pre-Section (CPS) services  such as TalkTalk and One.Tel  which route phone calls across non-BT networks from a local exchange. There are now more than 300 different firms offering CPS services and the percentage of people using BT lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.  
business,BMW reveals new models pipeline, BMW is preparing to enter the market for car-style people carriers  the firm's chief has told BBC News.  Speaking at a BMW event ahead of the Geneva motor show  Helmut Panke predicted demand for such crossover vehicles would soar in Europe. In contrast  he said  the popularity of van-style seven-seat vehicles and traditional saloon cars would fade.     Customers are moving out of the mini-van (and) traditional concepts are not as attractive anymore      he said.     We have decided that BMW will enter the [crossover] segment      he said in the clearest indication yet about the car maker's intentions.  Mr Panke praised the Honda Accura as the     best execution     yet of a crossover vehicle.     We have decided that the BMW brand will enter the segment      he said.  A decision on just how BMW will manage its entry into the new market is due in the first half of 2005. Typically it takes about three years from when a decision is taken before a new model hits the streets  Mr Panke said  implying that a BMW crossover could be on the market by 2008. The coming switch is driven in part by the need for successful carmakers to stay aware of trans-Atlantic differences in the car market  Mr Panke insisted. While in the US drivers tend to prefer sports utility vehicles (SUVs)  such as the BMW X5 and its sibling X3  in Europe demand for crossover vehicles is likely to be considerable  Mr Panke said.     There's a growing market here      he said.     We are going to go that way.  
business,House prices suffer festive fall,UK house prices fell 0.7% in December  according to figures from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.  Nationally  house prices rose at an annual rate of 10.7% in December  less than the 13.7% rise the previous month. The average UK house price fell from £180 126 in November to £178 906  reflecting recent Land Registry figures confirming a slowdown in late 2004. All major UK regions  apart from Northern Ireland  experienced a fall in annual growth during December.  December is traditionally a quiet month for the housing market because of Christmas celebrations. However  recent figures from the Land Registry - showing a big drop in sales between the last quarter of 2004 and the previous year - suggested the slowdown could be more than a seasonal blip. The volume of sales between October and December dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003  the Land Registry said. Although both the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Land Registry figures point to a slowdown in the market  the most recent surveys from Nationwide and Halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. After registering falls at the back-end of 2004  Halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in January and Nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year. 
business,Gold falls on IMF sale concerns, The price of gold has fallen after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief.  By revaluing its holdings  the IMF may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world's poorest nations. The plan was put forward by G7 finance ministers over the weekend. The price of gold fell to $413.50 an ounce in Asia  before rebounding slightly in early European trading.  IMF boss Rodrigo Rato was asked by G7 ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves.  He is expected to present his conclusions at an IMF meeting in Washington during April.     Whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the April IMF meetings      said John Reade  an analyst at UBS. The IMF values its gold reserves at between $40 and $50 an ounce  a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metal's current market value. The IMF has 3 217 tonnes of gold  or about 113.5m ounces. Bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the IMF's balance sheet  giving it more money to distribute.  This idea has been put forward before  but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty.     This is the first time there has been a mention of the use of gold in a G7 communiqué for achieving debt relief      said UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. At their meeting in London  G7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts owed by some of the world's poorest countries. Mr Brown said the meeting would be remembered as     the 100% debt relief summit    . While debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda  not everyone is convinced that selling IMF gold is the best way forward. The US  which can veto any plan to sell IMF gold should it so choose  said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem.     The US is not convinced that's the necessary way to do it      said Treasury Under Secretary John Taylor. Canada  a key gold producer  also expressed reservations.
entertainment,Ring of Fire hit co-writer dies,Merle Kilgore  co-writer of the country hit Ring of Fire  has died of congestive heart failure aged 70.  He started out as a singer and songwriter before going into music management  looking after country star Hank Williams Jr. He wrote Ring of Fire with June Carter Cash  the future wife of Johnny Cash who went on to score his most popular hit with the track. Kilgore had heart surgery in 2004 and was also diagnosed with lung cancer. His death has been attributed to treatment he was undergoing for the cancer. His first self-penned top 10 hit was Dear Mama in 1959.  One of the first songs he wrote for other artists was Wolverton Mountain  which sold 10 million copies when recorded by Claude King. He then wrote Ring of Fire with June Carter Cash  which was about her unrequited love for Johnny  who she later married. It was first recorded by her younger sister Anita Carter before Johnny went on to make such a success of it. June Carter Cash previously said it upset her husband when Kilgore talked about the song without crediting her and believed he should not have been credited on it. Last year  Kilgore turned up an awards dinner in a wheelchair expecting to honour Hank Williams Jr  but instead he was the surprise recipient of a lifetime achievement award from the International Entertainment Buyers Association. 
politics,Council tax rise 'reasonable', Welsh councils should set their taxes at     reasonable levels     after being given an average funding increase of 6%  says the assembly government.  Finance Minister Sue Essex said it was a     good deal     for local government. The £3.2bn settlement includes the     full     £7.4m from the UK Treasury announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown. But opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. In addition  £13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. She said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was     confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels.     The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that     significant     cuts to services may still be unavoidable. After the announcement WLGA finance spokesman Bob Wellington  of Torfaen  said it was vital that rises were minimsed.     A limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems      said Mr Wellington.     It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase.     On Monday  a delegation of north Wales councils visited Ms Essex to lobby for increased funds. Ms Essex said:     I have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises.     I have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and I am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax  particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties.     She said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels      even for those people who have moved up a band    .  The settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. Ms Essex said:     This is a good deal for local government  which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. It is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level.     Plaid Cymru's local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement     hugely disappointing    . He said:     Wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. This is not whinging as the Labour Assembly Government so often claims - it is anger.         This will mean either a massive hike in council tax  massive cuts in services provided by councils  or both.     Mike German  leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly  claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. Mr German said:     I know from my discussions with Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. But the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty.     Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change     is taking spin to the very verge of deception    . He added:     Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.  
politics,McConnell details Scots wave toll, At least three people from Scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list  the first minister has told MSPs.  The figures came out during a statement by Jack McConnell to the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday. He formally expressed Scotland's sympathy for the victims of the Indian Ocean tidal wave which killed 150 000. Mr McConnell went on to promise that Scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort. He said the provisional figures on the dead and lost had been provided by the police.  Mr McConnell said the tragedy should persuade everyone to step up the fight against global poverty and change the world for the better. He said he was proud of the generous response of people in Scotland to the disaster appeal  which is expected soon to top £20m. The first minister also praised Scottish Water for immediately flying bottled water and five large generators to the disaster zone. The Scottish Executive has seconded 11 staff to the aid agencies.  But he said Scotland was     in it for the long term     with help planned for fishing communities  for children's services  and for the aid charities. He said 2005 must be the year that Scotland showed clearly it cared for what happened to people elsewhere in the world  whether in Asia or in Africa. Mr McConnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the Make Poverty History campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities  trade unions and churches in the run-up to the G8 summit in Gleneagles in July. Edinburgh architect  Dominic Stephenson  became the first Scot to be confirmed as a victim of the Asian tsunami. The 27-year-old was holidaying on the Thai island of Koh Phi Phi with Eileen Lee  24. She is still missing.
